Tsu widget to share your profile / invitation with your readers.

== Description ==

NOTE: This plugin serves as a mini-plugin until Tsu releases an official public API.

The Tsu plugin adds a widget to place a link to your Tsu profile in your sidebar. Your readers can then easily visit your Tsu profile and use it as your invitation to the network.
You can optionally add a name to be displayed and choose if a logo should be shown in different sizes.

Translations:
* English, German & Spanish ([Armando LÃ¼scher](https://www.tsu.co/noplanman))
* Dutch ([Elza van Swieten](http://tsunl.nl))

For a manual installation:
1. Upload `tsu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

3. Go to 'Appearance -> Widgets' and add the 'Tsu Widget' to your sidebar and add your details.
